# Running the app on development

- yarn start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
- yarn android
- yarn ios
- yarn web

# Running & testing the app on your phone

- go to the App Store or Google Play and download the Expo app
- go to https://expo.io/@steven4354/commonplace and enter either your email or phone #. see this video for an example: https://www.loom.com/share/16a5dccded7043b99a0a1c92a75b369e
- on your phone open the email or the sms's link and it will open the app in Expo 

**Notes**:
To run the test version of the app for free we can use an app called Expo. Later on, we'll deploy this on Testflight & publish a public version on App Store and Google Play, but this Expo is an easy way to rapidly test :)
